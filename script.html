HEAVEN STONES<br>
X 000 B.C.<br>
-21°C <br>
76° 8′ 0″ N, 64° 56′ 0″ W <br>
Cape York, Thule Region, Northern Greenland, autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark<br>

Ahnighito (Tent), Woman, Dog, Savik I, Thule, Savik II, Agpalilik (Man), and Tunorput arrived from the heavens. Upon hitting the ice, their magnetic memories melted. No longer remnant of their origin, the iron visitors re-calibrated, re-adjusted, and re-froze into the local geological conditions.
<br><br>
As a meteorite burns through the Earth’s atmosphere, it heats up above its Curie temperature and loses its extraterrestrial magnetic field; and while the alien traveller disposes of its native mineral characteristics, it also assimilates into the surrounding landscape. A new set of geological DNA is being generated.
<br><br>
The indigenous people sensed the animate character of the heavenly objects and morphed the meteoric iron further, into the shapes of tools and weapons. Inuit harpoon heads, knives and ulos predate the Iron Age by hundreds of years. The meteorites in the ice sparked the technological advancements in the Arctic.

IRON MOUNTAINS<br>
2020-21 A.D. <br>
-11°C <br>
76° 8′ 0″ N, 64° 56′ 0″ W <br>
Cape York, Thule Region, Northern Greenland, autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark<br>
<br>
Melville Bugt, Inglefield Land, Maarmorilik, De Dødes Fjord, Pingorssuit, Kap Seddon, Saveruluk, Hammer Dal, Isukasia (ISUA), Isortoq and Itilliarsuk stir up from hibernation. Climate change melts the freeze, unhinging the metallic masses from their bedrocks.
<br><br>
Exposed to the surface, these minerals are an open invite for extraction licenses. Thousands of years ago, the Inuits used basalt stones to chip off fragments of iron meteorites to model their devices. Today, geologists employed by mining companies drill out, cut off, and measure up mineral samples from the open bedrock.
<br><br>
The unfolding of a new geological spectacle becomes charted, measured, and calculated. Prices of minerals shrink and expand like the Arctic ice. The licenses for digging become investments for global players, who bet in favour of the catastrophe to open up new mining frontiers.
<br><br>
In the past, the natives from north of Whale Sound decapitated the Woman meteorite and sledged her iron head away. This maddened the weather demon, who pierced a crack through the ice sheet, swallowing the piece of the heavenly stone. The Inuits narrowly escaped their last breath, understanding that Nature retains its own resources.

MAGNETIC BREATHS<br>
Time stretches and squeezes<br>
Temperature shoots and sinks<br>
Space expands and retracts<br>
<br>
Anirniq — breath, anirniit — many breaths, silla — breath of life. The spirit of every living being is borrowed from the sky and the air around them. The seal seeks out a beautiful harpoon head in order to be killed without pain. If the design follows the rule of ritual and custom, the seal’s spirit will reside in the harpoon head for one night after its death.
<br><br>
The harpoon is not a weapon, but a communication device to facilitate the passage of breaths from one body to another. The indigenous people live in tune with nature. The design of their hunting instruments responds to ecological circumstances, where the arrival of new species demands new shapes and ornaments.
<br><br>
Inspired by the Inuit relationship with landscape, ruled by weather demons, staggering rocks and exchanges of breaths, the film “Out of Focus” will propose a new reading of the Greenlandic tormented tundra. Drawing on the idea of silla — breath of life, we would like to challenge the colonial extractive relationship with the Arctic landscape.
<br><br>
The film explores the myth-making potentials of ‘iron mountains’ by harvesting, analysing, and changing their magnetic breaths. This focus will unfold the role of metallics in ecological shifting and its mark on social realities.
<br><br>
MATERIAL LENSES<br>
2020-21 A.D. <br>
76° 8′ 0″ N, 64° 56′ 0″ W <br>
<br>
The shifting topographies of the Arctic breathe a necessity for new reading methods.
“Out of Focus” will supplement the camera optics with custom-made material lenses.
These geo-tools will monitor the magnetic anomalies unearthed by climate change on site in Cape York, Greenland.
<br><br>
Instead of relying on vision, “Out of Focus” employs other methods of sensing. A magnetometer will measure the magnetic anomalies of the terrain, caused by the natural presence of iron deposits. A radar will search for the strongest signals of the environment emitted by artificial sources, such as the military air base apparatuses or weather satellites. Such instruments will translate the electromagnetic waves into sonic representations.
<br><br>
“Out of Focus” employs a technique of navigating the landscape, referring to the Inuit wooden coastal maps, which are read by touch. The film showcases methods to destabilise the mode of vision as a primary source of knowledge production.
<br><br>
Throughout the process, a series of collaborations with science institutions, private tech companies, and anthropologists will take place exploring the changes of landscape and society powered by top-down extraction.
