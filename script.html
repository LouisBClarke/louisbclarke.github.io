Ahnighito (Tent), Woman, Dog, Savik I, Thule, Savik II, Agpalilik (Man), and Tunorput arrived from the heavens.
Upon hitting the ice, their magnetic memories melted. No longer remnant of their origin, the iron visitors re-calibrated, re-adjusted, and re-froze into the local geological conditions.
As a meteorite burns through the Earth’s atmosphere, it heats up above its Curie temperature and loses its extraterrestrial magnetic field;
and while the alien traveller disposes of its native mineral characteristics, it also assimilates into the surrounding landscape.
The indigenous people sensed the animate character of the heavenly objects and morphed the meteoric iron further, into the shapes of tools and weapons.
Inuit harpoon heads, knives and ulos predate the Iron Age by hundreds of years. The meteorites in the ice sparked the technological advancements in the Arctic.

Melville Bugt, Inglefield Land, Maarmorilik, De Dødes Fjord, Pingorssuit, Kap Seddon, Saveruluk, Hammer Dal, Isukasia (ISUA), Isortoq and Itilliarsuk stir up from hibernation.
Climate change melts the freeze, unhinging the metallic masses from their bedrocks.
Exposed to the surface, these minerals are an open invite for extraction licenses.
Thousands of years ago, the Inuits used basalt stones to chip off fragments of iron meteorites to model their devices. Today, geologists employed by mining companies drill out, cut off, and measure up mineral samples from the open bedrock.
The unfolding of a new geological spectacle becomes charted, measured, and calculated. Prices of minerals shrink and expand like the Arctic ice.
The licenses for digging become investments for global players, who bet in favour of the catastrophe to open up new mining frontiers.

The shifting topographies of the Arctic breathe a necessity for new reading methods.
“Out of Focus” will supplement the camera optics with custom-made material lenses.
These geo-tools will monitor the magnetic anomalies unearthed by climate change on site in Cape York, Greenland.
Instead of relying on vision, “Out of Focus” employs other methods of sensing.
This technique of navigating the landscape refers to the Inuit wooden coastal maps, which are read by touch.
Throughout the process, a series of dialogues with scientists, philosophers, anthropologists and individual characters will take place exploring the changes of landscape and society powered by extraction.
