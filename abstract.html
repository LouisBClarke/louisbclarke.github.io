          In the geological era of the Anthropocene
we see rapid and artificial shifts in
the land both above and below our feet.
This is seen in the western idea of nature
as ‘the other’ and land-grab domination
mentality, where zones of climatic changes
present themselves. My position in the
field of media arts is to disassemble this
idea of ‘the other’ and develop collective
knowledge through research, tools, formulas,
and narratives, with an all-inclusive
creative mentality. The work and research
trajectory I undertake analyses new ways
of seeing, reading and communicating
with our shifting climatic landscape.
The different topographics and artificial
landmasses of the current contemporary
landscape breathe a necessity
for new perceptions, and technologies
that require a shift in reading. This is due
to rapid climatic shifts characterising
our landscape, almost unpresent to humans.
I will therefore be exploring methods
to destabilise the mode of vision as
a primary source of knowledge production,
and instil new languages into processes
of understanding the Earth.
My previous project Untangling Noises
of Matter serves as a prototype for
this coming development period. In this
work, an instrument, coined the Radio
Ear, is used by a land surveyor to record
movement and amplification of iron ore.
The processes of surveying undertake
a cinematic method in which non-invasive
recordings take place — using the
ear as a lens, spatial conditions as framerate,
and materiality as film storage.
<br><br>
The predominant method of reading
our landscape is dictated by optics (eye,
camera lens, and sensor), a standardisation
I would like to shift. I aim to do this
through reading the environment via material
lenses that produce documentation
as a new form of cinema. The material
experiments, tool-building, and narratives
I will explore during the development year
will become a research format into the
Earth as a medium, language, and carrier.
<br><br>
During the forthcoming year I plan to
develop an instrumental measuring device
that utilises Paleomagnetism, a scientific
study of how minerals store data.
This tool would become a method for researching,
producing content and opening
discussions through a non-linear outlook.
A mining company would normally
utilise geo-tools for violent capital extraction,
however I examine the multiple
ways of using these tools for a creative
and non-damaging outcome. A distinct
and original position in the cultural sector
is found through the re-appropriation and
invention of geological instruments as
a new form of digital story-telling.
<br><br>
This idea of non-invasive analysing
follows the notion of Material Witness,
a concept by forensic artist Susan Schuppli
in which the role of matter acts as
both trace evidence of external events,
and as a facsimile of process. This results
in an understanding of the landscape as
an already encoded material waiting to
be deciphered in multiple ways. By developing
this tool, and technology, a new
lens for both viewing and understanding
can be established. This will help me to
bridge between the temporality of cinema,
A Moment in Time, and the longevity
of geological processes, Deep Time.
Through my research I want to make visible
the interconnections between temporal
time and geological time.<br><br>
It is within this terrain of the invisible
that the project is unique, by building
tools and methods to break such physical
and political barriers. This strives to bring
communities closer to awareness and
forms of action. The geological processes
I investigate require non-visual means
to be better understood. In my artistic
practice, my goal is to design and develop
a series of methods, cartographies, data-
sets, narratives, films, and field initiatives
to uncover these invisible truths that
shake our landscapes.
